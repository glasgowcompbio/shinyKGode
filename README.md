# ShinyKGode

Many processes in science and engineering can be described by dynamical systems based on nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Often ODE parameters are unknown and not directly measurable. Since nonlinear ODEs typically have no closed form solution, standard iterative inference procedures  require a computationally expensive numerical integration of the ODEs every time the parameters are adapted, which in practice restricts statistical inference to very small systems. To overcome this computational bottleneck, approximate methods based on gradient matching have recently gained much attention.

In this package, we develop an easy-to-use application in Shiny to perform parameter inference on ODEs using gradient matching. The application, called `shinyKGode`, is built upon the [KGode](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KGode/index.html) package, which implements the kernel ridge regression and the gradient matching algorithm proposed in [Niu et al. (2016)](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/niu16.html) and the warping algorithm proposed in [Niu et al. (2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00180-017-0753-z) for parameter inference in differential equations.

`shinyKGode` has built-in support for the following three models described in [Niu et al. (2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00180-017-0753-z):
- [Lotka-Volterra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations), which describes the dynamics of ecological
systems with predator-prey interactions.
-  [FitzHughâ€“Nagumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model)), which is a two-dimensional dynamical system used for modelling spike generation in axons.
- The Biopathway model described in [y Vyshemirsky and Girolami (2008)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/24/6/833/192524), which is a model for the interactions of five protein isoforms.

Additionally, `shinyKGode` can also accept user-defined models (in SBML v2 format) through the [SBMLR parser](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SBMLR.html). Advanced features such as ODE regularisation and warping can be easily used for inference through the application.


## Installation

The latest version of the `shinyKGode` package can be installed from this github repository using `devtools`:

```R
library(devtools)
install_github('joewandy/shinyKGode')
```

While the stable R package (under submission) can be installed from CRAN via `install.packages('shinyKGode')`.

## Running shinyKGode

Once installed, the application can be run by:

```R
library(shinyKGode)
startShinyKGode()
```
