#' shinyKGode: A Shiny package for gradient matching parameter inference on 
#' ordinary differential equations.
#'
#' The shinyKGode package provides three main functions:
#' a friendly Shiny-based user-interface to run gradient matching to solve 
#' ordinary differential equations, a selection of three built-in models
#' and also the ability to import user-defined differential equations and 
#' perform parameter inference on them.
