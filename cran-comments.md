## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Fixed a bug with uninitialised variable that cause warping + bootstrap not to run.
- Fixed inconsistent plot legend for the solved ODE with initial + inferred parameters
- Returned the correct dataframe when downloading parameters

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
