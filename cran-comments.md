## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Updated the README.md file to put the CRAN URL there in canonical form. This is for the note below:

Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
 URL: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KGode/index.html
   From: README.md
   Status: 200
   Message: OK
   CRAN URL not in canonical form
 The canonical URL of the CRAN page for a package is
   https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pkgname

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
