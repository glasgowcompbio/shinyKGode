## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Improved plots
- Misc. small bugfixes
- Fixed a broken link in the README file

## Test environments

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
