## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Updated the bootstrap procedure to compute the median absolute deviation, rather than the interquartile range.
- Minor user interface changes to the bootstrap fields.
- Removed 'tools' from Imports in the DESCRIPTION, as it is unused.

I have read CRAN policies regarding rapid resubmissions, and I sincerely apologise for this (we need this for the paper). It won't happen again!

I also wish the maintainers a very nice day, and I would like to show my appreciation for all the work you've done :)

## Test environments
